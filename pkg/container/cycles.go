// CycleDetector implements cycle detection in container dependency graphs using the three-color DFS algorithm.
//
// The three-color DFS algorithm is a graph traversal technique that detects cycles by maintaining
// three states for each node during depth-first search:
//
//  1. White (0): Node has not been visited yet. Represents unexplored territory in the graph.
//  2. Gray (1): Node is currently being visited (in the current DFS path). If we encounter a gray
//     node while traversing, it indicates a back edge and thus a cycle.
//  3. Black (2): Node has been fully explored, including all its descendants. No cycles can exist
//     through this node in future traversals.
//
// Cycle Detection Logic:
//
//	When DFS visits a node, it marks it gray and adds it to the current path.
//	For each neighbor:
//		- If white: Recurse on it (continue exploration)
//		- If gray: Cycle detected! Mark all nodes from the gray node to current node in the path as cyclic
//		- If black: Already fully explored, no cycle through this edge
//	After exploring all neighbors, mark node black and remove from path (backtrack)
//
// This algorithm efficiently detects all nodes involved in cycles in a single pass, with
// Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V = vertices (containers), E = edges (dependencies)
// Space Complexity: O(V) for color map, path stack, and recursion depth
//
// Data Structures:
//   - graph: Adjacency list mapping container names to their dependency lists (outgoing edges)
//   - colors: State map for three-color algorithm (0=white, 1=gray, 2=black)
//   - cycles: Result map marking containers involved in cycles (true = cyclic)
//   - path: Current DFS path for cycle reconstruction when back edges are found.

// dfs performs depth-first search to detect cycles in the dependency graph using the three-color algorithm.
//
// This method implements the core cycle detection logic by traversing the graph depth-first while
// maintaining the current path and node states. When a back edge to a gray (visiting) node is found,
// all nodes in the cycle (from the gray node to the current node in the path) are marked as cyclic.
//
// Algorithm Steps:
//  1. Mark current node as gray (visiting) and add to current path
//  2. For each dependency (neighbor) of current node:
//     a. If neighbor is white (unvisited): Recurse on neighbor to continue exploration
//     b. If neighbor is gray (visiting): CYCLE DETECTED!
//     - Find the position of neighbor in current path (start of cycle)
//     - Mark all nodes from cycle start to current node as involved in cycle
//     c. If neighbor is black (visited): Already fully explored, no cycle through this edge
//  3. After exploring all neighbors: Mark node black (fully visited) and remove from path (backtrack)
//
// Cycle Reconstruction:
// When a cycle is detected (back edge to gray node), the cycle consists of all nodes in the
// current path from the first occurrence of the gray node to the current node. This ensures
// all nodes participating in the cycle are correctly identified, even in complex multi-node cycles.
//
// Time Complexity: O(V + E) amortized across all DFS calls
// Space Complexity: O(V) for recursion stack in worst case (linear graph)
//
// Parameters:
//   - node: The container name to start DFS traversal from. Must exist in the graph.

	cd.path = append(cd.path, node)

		if cd.colors[neighbor] == 0 {

			// CYCLE DETECTED: Neighbor is currently being visited (gray)
			// This indicates a back edge in the DFS tree, meaning a cycle exists
			// All nodes from the first occurrence of neighbor in path to current node form the cycle

			// Find the starting index of the cycle in the current path

					cd.cycles[cd.path[i]] = true
				}
			}

		// If neighbor is black (2): Already fully explored, no cycle through this edge

// DetectCycles identifies all containers involved in circular dependencies using three-color DFS.
//
// This function constructs a directed dependency graph from container relationships and uses
// depth-first search with node coloring to detect all cycles. The algorithm ensures that
// every connected component of the graph is explored, identifying all containers that are
// part of any circular dependency chain.
//
// Graph Construction:
// 1. Each container becomes a node identified by its resolved container identifier
// 2. Dependencies (links) become directed edges from dependent to dependency
// 3. Container names are normalized to handle Docker Compose service name variations
// 4. Only containers present in the input list are included (missing dependencies ignored)
//
// DFS Traversal Strategy:
//   - Start DFS from each unvisited (white) node to ensure all components are explored
//   - The three-color algorithm detects cycles during traversal and marks all involved nodes
//   - Multiple DFS calls are needed because the graph may have disconnected components
//
// Implementation Rationale:
//   - Uses adjacency list representation for efficient neighbor iteration (O(1) per edge)
//   - Normalization ensures consistent handling of Docker Compose vs container names
//   - Returns all cyclic nodes rather than just detecting presence, enabling targeted handling
//   - Single pass through graph with O(V + E) complexity makes it suitable for large deployments
//
// Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V = containers, E = dependency links
// Space Complexity: O(V + E) for graph storage and DFS recursion stack
//
// Edge Cases:
//   - Empty container list: Returns empty map
//   - No dependencies: Returns empty map (no cycles possible)
//   - Single container with self-dependency: Detected as cycle
//   - Multiple disconnected cycles: All detected and marked
//   - Missing dependency targets: Ignored (only analyze provided containers)
//
// Parameters:
//   - containers: List of containers to analyze for cycles. Should not be nil.
//   - useComposeDependsOn: Whether to include Docker Compose depends_on label in dependency resolution.
//
// Returns:
//   - map[string]bool: Map where keys are container names and values indicate cycle involvement.
//     true = container is part of at least one cycle, false/absent = no cycles detected.
//     Empty map returned if no cycles found.
