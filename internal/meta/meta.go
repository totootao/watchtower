// Package meta provides centralized application metadata for Watchtower.
//
// It holds compile-time values such as the version string and derived
// identifiers (e.g., the HTTP User-Agent header).
// Version is typically injected via linker flags at build time.
// If unset it falls back to "v0.0.0-unknown".
